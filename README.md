# FIF_DashboardApp

Dashboard application developed for a non profit organization. The goal of the product was to essentially digitalize the store operations, such as creating a membership program and tracking system for their customers/users, as well as, a tracking system for daily transactions via users, donations, product stock and more. 

My role included but was not limited to: Building the front-end interface with JavaScript and HTML, and utilized the PostgreSQL database, Node.js and JavaScript for back-end requests and architecture. Deployed full stack application to heroku. 

Due to privacy and intellectual property related reasons the original code of the product cannot be displayed.
