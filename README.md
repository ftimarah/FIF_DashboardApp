# FIF_DashboardApp
On going development of a dashboard application for the non profit organization Feed it Forward. The goal of the product is to digitalize the store operations, such as creating a membership program for their customers information and a tracking system to monitor daily transactions. Also, we are currently developing a tracking system to monitor and log product stock, donations/amount donated, and additional analytics.
